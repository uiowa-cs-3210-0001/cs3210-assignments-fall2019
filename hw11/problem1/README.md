# HW11 â€” Problem 1

## Problem statement

"Hey, check this out!" shouted Bob across the room as he as was walking briskly towards your desk. "I'm getting pretty good at this [test first](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/testfirst.html) thing!" he continued, "But I need your help with the implementation." "Test first, huh... More like test only," you thought to yourself, as you begrudgingly opened Bob's code.

Help Bob to finish his area map implementation according to the [provided test cases](https://repl.it/@agurtovoy/hw11-problem1) ([`main.cpp`](main.cpp)) . Do not modify the tests.
